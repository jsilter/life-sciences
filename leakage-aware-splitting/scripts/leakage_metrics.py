"""Leakage metrics and split invariants, shared across all modalities.

Two kinds of checks live here:

1. Deterministic invariants any correct split MUST satisfy regardless of data
   (partition completeness/disjointness, cluster integrity, threshold compliance,
   temporal monotonicity, reproducibility). These return structured results so
   tests and the orchestrator can assert on them.

2. Quality statistics that quantify how much leakage remains (the realized max
   train<->test similarity, and the nearest-neighbour similarity distribution).
   These take a `similarity` callable so the same code serves sequences
   (identity), structures (TM-score), and molecules (Tanimoto).

A similarity function here returns a value in [0, 1] where 1 == identical and the
leakage threshold is an upper bound the test set must stay below relative to train.
